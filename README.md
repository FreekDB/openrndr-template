# aBe's OPENRNDR experiments

This repository is a clone of https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-template

It contains over 200 Kotlin programs which I have written between 2019 and 2022. 
Some might not be in a working state.
Some are minimal tests of a certain feature while others are more
complex and include a user interface, shader effects, etc. Some programs produce SVG
files as output meant to be used with a pen plotter. One day I may finish
writing description for all programs and organize them in meaningful folders.
